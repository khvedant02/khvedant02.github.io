Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student specializing in artificial intelligence, with a focus on generative models and knowledge graph integration. My research interests lie at the intersection of technology and societal impact, particularly how AI can enhance mental health support systems and improve decision-making processes in dynamic environments.

You can find some of my academic contributions and projects on the [publications page](/publications/).
