I am a PhD student at Artificial Intelligence Institute (AIISC), University of South Carolina. I am co-advised by [Dr. Amit Sheth](https://amit.aiisc.ai/) and [Dr. Forest Agostinelli](https://cse.sc.edu/~foresta/). My research interests include Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology in Naya Raipur, India, in 2020.

My research ambition is to develop AI technologies that solve complex and dynamic problems. I focus on designing foundational models that effectively address pathfinding problems and integrating large language models with knowledge graphs to build secure and effective mental health conversational agents. My contributions in generative AI have significantly enhanced the efficiency of systematic reviews in academic research, notably reducing the time required for scholarly article retrieval by up to 90%.

My academic involvement extends beyond research. I have actively participated as a teaching assistant for courses such as Artificial Intelligence and Database System Design and am a regular reviewer for leading conferences and journals including ICLR, ICAPS, and IEEE Internet Computing.
