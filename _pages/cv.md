Education
======
* **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, University of South Carolina, 2021 - 2026 (expected)
  * Advisor: Amit Sheth
  * Award: Best Poster Award at DISCOVER USC 2024, "Foundation Model For Pathfinding Problems" (>500 participants)
* **M.S. in Computer Science**, University of South Carolina, 2025
  * Completed as part of direct Ph.D. program
* **B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering**, International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur, 2020
  * Award: Institute Gold Medal for Best All-Round Performance

Work Experience
======
* **Summer Research Intern**, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, May 2025 - August 2025
  * Developed a multi-agent fast–slow architecture (SOFAI-LM) with a metacognitive feedback loop to enhance LLM reasoning
  * Demonstrated that the architecture helps an LLM outperform a standalone LRM in both accuracy and speed
  * Identified that LLM history aids the LRM on local tasks (debugging) but hinders it on global tasks (graph coloring)
  * Contributed to two patent applications and the accepted AAAI'26 Lab proposal

* **Research Affiliate**, Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of South Carolina, December 2019 - July 2020
  * Developed a knowledge-infused machine learning pipeline for assessing the psychological impacts of pandemics using tweets
  * Analyzed 12 billion COVID-19 tweets to study the spatiotemporal effect of the pandemic and policy decisions
